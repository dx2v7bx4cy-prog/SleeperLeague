DazzaD1 survives with 110.35 to move to 6-5. With three weeks left, the top of the standings is LOCKED, but the middle is an absolute BLOODBATH as teams fight for the final playoff spots.</p>

                <h4>Matchup 1: MaHomie N Herbie (110.35) def. Deep Balls and Grimace (87.75)</h4>
                <p>DazzaD1 survives Week 11 with 110.35 points — and in a week where nobody could score, that was MORE than enough. Justin Herbert doing his thing at QB. Kenneth Walker and Chase Brown combining for solid RB production. Trey McBride being a reliable TE option. Patrick Mahomes available as QB depth. This wasn't pretty, but it was effective, and that's all that matters.</p>
                <p>At 6-5 with three games left, they're RIGHT on the playoff bubble. This win was absolutely critical. One more loss and things get DICEY. The margin for error is razor-thin, but this team is still controlling their own destiny. Win games, make playoffs. It's that simple.</p>
                <p>ronaldmcdonaId drops to 3-8 after scoring 87.75 points — which honestly isn't even that bad considering the week everyone else had. Lamar Jackson at QB, Josh Jacobs at RB, Ladd McConkey at WR, and Jordan Love as QB depth all put up respectable numbers. But when you're 3-8, respectable doesn't cut it anymore. The season is over, and these final three weeks are just about not finishing in dead last.</p>

                <h4>Matchup 2: Push Tush for Reggie Bush (115.05) def. Surtainly Autistic (99.85)</h4>
                <p>GrifReaper continues the hot streak with 115.05 points to move to 7-4! Trevor Lawrence at QB. The Detroit stack of Jahmyr Gibbs and Amon-Ra St. Brown doing what they do best. Pittsburgh D coming through. This roster is absolutely CLICKING at the perfect time, and at 7-4 with three games left, they're basically LOCKED into the playoffs.</p>
                <p>This team has figured out the formula. Lean on the Detroit offense. Trust Trevor Lawrence. Let the defense contribute. It's working week after week, and this is exactly the kind of consistency you want heading into the postseason. This is a DANGEROUS team that nobody wants to face in the playoffs.</p>
                <p>PackJhilp drops to 3-8 after scoring 99.85 points. Derrick Henry still being Derrick Henry at RB. DeVonta Smith and Jameson Williams at WR putting up decent numbers. Caleb Williams and J.J. McCarthy providing QB depth. The talent is there, but at 3-8, the season is over. These final three weeks are about playing spoiler and finishing with some dignity.</p>

                <h4>Matchup 3: They Hit The 2nd Bower (104.2) def. Kmet the frog (95.6)</h4>
                <p>LewDogz puts together a solid 104.2-point performance to move to 4-7! Matthew Stafford at QB doing what he does. Kyren Williams and Aaron Jones providing that RB stability. Brock Bowers showing why he's one of the best rookie TEs in the league. Rachaad White and Mark Andrews filling in nicely. This is what happens when a roster finally clicks for a week.</p>
                <p>At 4-7, they're eliminated from playoff contention, but this win shows there's still fight in this team. These final three weeks are about pride and playing spoiler to other teams' playoff dreams. And with performances like this, they're absolutely capable of ruining someone's season.</p>
                <p>williamdundas27 falls to 3-8 after scoring 95.6 points. Joe Flacco at QB, James Cook and Ashton Jeanty at RB, Ja'Marr Chase at WR, Tua Tagovailoa as QB depth — the pieces are there, but it wasn't enough. George Pickens and Romeo Doubs couldn't get it done at WR. At 3-8, the season is effectively over, but losing by just 8.6 points has to sting. That's the kind of loss that makes you wonder "what if."</p>

                <h4>Matchup 4: tim7w (143.8) def. Mals Pals (117.95)</h4>
                <p>tim7w EXPLODES for 143.8 points to move to 8-3! Jalen Hurts at QB doing Jalen Hurts things. Christian McCaffrey showing he's still ELITE when healthy. Drake London and Deebo Samuel contributing at WR. Travis Kelce being reliable at TE. Jared Goff providing solid QB depth. This is what a complete, championship-caliber roster looks like when it's firing on all cylinders.</p>
                <p>At 8-3 with three games left, they're LOCKED into the playoffs. This team is peaking at exactly the right time, and they're looking like a legitimate championship contender. The depth, the consistency, the star power — it's all there. This is a team that can go all the way.</p>
                <p>Mahl drops to 3-8 after scoring 117.95 points — which honestly would've been competitive in most weeks, but not when you're facing a team that drops 143.8. Baker Mayfield at QB, Jaylen Warren and Kimani Vidal at RB, CeeDee Lamb at WR, Kyle Pitts at TE — the roster put up a respectable score. But when your opponent is in THAT zone, there's nothing you can do. At 3-8, the season is over, but at least this wasn't an embarrassing loss.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="matchup" data-teams="jackingoff postchubb">
                <h4>Matchup 5: JackinGoff (127.05) def. Post Chubb Depression (116.25)</h4>
                <p>JackinGoff moves to an ABSURD 10-1 record with a 127.05-point performance! Drake Maye at QB continues to impress. Bijan Robinson and Breece Hall forming an ELITE RB duo. Puka Nacua showing up at WR. George Kittle being reliable at TE. This team just finds ways to WIN, week after week after week.</p>
                <p>10-1. TEN AND ONE. This team is tied with Pete for the best record in the league, and they're doing it in a completely different way. Where Pete dominates with sheer firepower, Jacob wins with consistency and clutch performances. At 10-1, they're LOCKED into the playoffs and looking like a legitimate championship threat.</p>
                <p>Snackadaktal falls to 5-6 after scoring 116.25 points — which is a QUALITY LOSS if there ever was one. Bo Nix at QB, Saquon Barkley at RB, Justin Jefferson and Nico Collins at WR, Tee Higgins in the flex — this roster put up serious points. But when you're facing a buzzsaw, sometimes good isn't good enough.</p>
                <p>At 5-6 with three games left, they're RIGHT on the playoff bubble. This loss HURTS. Every game from here is a must-win. The margin for error is GONE, and the playoff dreams are hanging by a thread.</p>

            <div class="matchup" data-teams="kempsey rashees">
                <h4>Matchup 6: Kempsey Cum and fuck mes (134.8) def. Rashee's Ricests (79.3)</h4>
                <p>PELICANPETE STRIKES AGAIN with 134.8 points to move to 10-1! Josh Allen being Josh Allen at QB. De'Von Achane exploding for huge RB numbers. Davante Adams and Jaxon Smith-Njigba producing at WR. Courtland Sutton in the flex. Sam Darnold providing QB depth. This is what DOMINANCE looks like.</p>
                <p>At 10-1 with 1,775 total points, Pete isn't just winning — he's OBLITERATING the competition. This team has been elite ALL SEASON LONG, and there's no signs of slowing down. Josh Allen is having an MVP-caliber fantasy season, and the supporting cast just keeps delivering. This is the championship favorite, period.</p>
                <p>ChubbyChaser20 drops to 4-7 after scoring just 79.3 points in a BRUTAL 55.5-point blowout. Geno Smith at QB couldn't get it going. Travis Etienne and Emari Demercado at RB were invisible. DK Metcalf and Rashid Shaheed at WR couldn't produce. Hunter Henry at TE? Nothing. This was a complete roster failure from top to bottom.</p>
                <p>To lose by 55.5 points is just DEVASTATING. To score under 80 points in Week 11 is unacceptable. At 4-7, the season is effectively over, but this is the kind of loss that stings. This is the kind of performance you want to forget immediately.</p>

            <h3>🏆 TOAST OF THE WEEK: tim7w 🏆</h3>
            <p>143.8 POINTS. ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE POINT EIGHT POINTS. This is what ELITE looks like in Week 11.</p>
            <p>tim7w just put on an absolute CLINIC in how to dominate fantasy football. Jalen Hurts going nuclear at QB. Christian McCaffrey showing the league he's BACK and better than ever. Drake London and Deebo Samuel producing at WR. Travis Kelce being the steady veteran presence at TE. Jared Goff providing high-quality QB depth. This is a COMPLETE roster firing on all cylinders.</p>
            <p>At 8-3 with 1,425 total points, this team is LOCKED into the playoffs and looking like a legitimate championship contender. This isn't just a good team — this is a team that's hitting its peak at EXACTLY the right time. The balance, the depth, the star power — it's all there.</p>
            <p>143.8 points is a STATEMENT. It's the high score of Week 11, and it wasn't even close. When you can drop that kind of performance this late in the season, it sends a message to the rest of the league: this team is FOR REAL, and they're coming for that championship.</p>
            <p>The scary part? This team still has room to improve. CMC is still getting back to full speed. The WR depth can produce even more. This isn't even their final form, and they're already putting up performances like this. That's TERRIFYING for the rest of the league.</p>
            <p>Raise your glass to championship-caliber performances. Raise your glass to peaking at the perfect time. Raise your glass to tim7w, who just reminded everyone that when the playoffs roll around, you want to be the team that's playing its best football. And right now, this team is playing ELITE football.</p>

            <h3>🔥 ROAST OF THE WEEK: ChubbyChaser20 & Rashee's Ricests 🔥</h3>
            <p>79.3 points. SEVENTY NINE POINT THREE POINTS. In Week 11. Against the league leader.</p>
            <p>Let's break down this absolute DISASTER piece by piece, shall we? Geno Smith at QB couldn't even get to double digits. Travis Etienne and Emari Demercado at RB combined for essentially nothing. DK Metcalf and Rashid Shaheed at WR were completely invisible. Hunter Henry at TE? Might as well have stayed on the bench. Keenan Allen providing NOTHING in the flex.</p>
            <p>This isn't just a bad week — this is a CATASTROPHIC FAILURE of epic proportions. This is the kind of performance that gets screenshotted and saved for the offseason roast sessions. This is the kind of score that becomes LEGEND for all the wrong reasons.</p>
            <p>You lost by 55.5 points. FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE. That's not a loss — that's a MASSACRE. That's the fantasy football equivalent of getting run over by a freight train while standing on the tracks. That's getting absolutely DEMOLISHED and having no earthly explanation for what went wrong.</p>
            <p>And here's the KICKER — you had Aaron Rodgers as your QB2, and you STILL couldn't crack 80 points. You had two quarterbacks, and you scored 79.3. That's almost IMPRESSIVE in how spectacularly terrible it is. That takes a special kind of roster implosion.</p>
            <p>At 4-7, the season is basically over. But this? This is something SPECIAL. This is the kind of performance that makes you question every decision you've made this season. Your draft picks. Your waiver wire moves. Your trade negotiations. Everything.</p>
            <p>79.3 points against the league leader. That's the number that will haunt you. That's the number that will be brought up at next year's draft. That's the number that defines Week 11 for you. And brother, there is NO recovering from that kind of embarrassment.</p>

It's CHAOS at the playoff bubble, and every game matters.</p>

                <p><strong>LOCKED IN (Top Seeds):</strong> Kempsey (10-1, 1775 pts), JackinGoff (10-1, 1438 pts) — These two are battling for the #1 seed</p>
                <p><strong>ESSENTIALLY LOCKED:</strong> tim7w (8-3, 1425 pts) — Would need a collapse to miss playoffs</p>
                <p><strong>IN STRONG POSITION:</strong> Push Tush (7-4, 1375 pts) — One more win likely locks it up</p>

                <h4 style="color: #e65100; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.2em;">THREE WEEKS. THAT'S IT.</h4>
                <p style="color: #34495e; line-height: 1.8;">The playoff spots are being decided RIGHT NOW. Check your injury reports obsessively. Work that waiver wire like your season depends on it (because it does). Make the tough calls. Trust your gut. In three weeks, six teams will be celebrating playoff berths and six teams will be wondering what could have been. The margin for error is GONE. Every single point matters. Every single decision matters. Every single game matters. This is where championships are won and lost. Don't blow it now.</p>
